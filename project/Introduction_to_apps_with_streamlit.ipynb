    "2. **Columns**: You can display the content into different vertical columns. This is very useful if you want to display several elements side by side, otherwise they would be organized vertically (a bit like using a Table in Word or the \"Columns\" feature).\n",
    "3. **Expander**: To create a zone that can be hidden when clicking on a title. This is very useful to show details only when the user want it and keep the display area clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **sidebar** is very easy to use: just do `st.sidebar.<widget>` instead of `st.<widget>` (e.g. `st.sidebar.text_input(...)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **columns** have a similar syntax as the sidebar: create your columns (e.g. `col1, col2 = st.columns(2)`) and then use these columns instead of the `st` keyword (e.g. `col1.text_input(...)`).\n",
    "\n",
    "The **expander** is using the `with` keyword:\n",
